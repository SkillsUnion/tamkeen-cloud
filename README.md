   - Explaining technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

4. **Continuous Learning and Adaptability**
   - Keeping up-to-date with the latest cloud technologies and best practices
   - Adapting to new tools and methodologies quickly

5. **Project Management**
   - Planning and executing cloud projects from inception to deployment
   - Managing resources and timelines effectively

## Curriculum Outline
Cloud Engineering Bootcamp contains few modules and courses days each, each of which culminates in a project. It requires students to complete module projects to continue in the Cloud Engineering Bootcamp.

The following is a diagram of Rocket's curriculum. Module 1 introduces the relationship between client and server and how a frontend server can serve a client-side application. Module 2 introduces a 3rd-party backend service (Firebase) that our frontend apps can use to store data. Module 3 introduces how to build a backend service of our own. Throughout the course we will learn algorithms to bolster our foundations and prepare for coding interviews.

You may notice Rocket's docs often reference official docs, guides and tutorials for the content we teach, for example with React, Firebase and Sequelize. We do this because the official docs are often the best explanations, and Rocket supplements those explanations with our own expertise of what students at our levels are likely to understand. All Rocket exercises are intentionally and meticulously designed to suit our students' experience levels.

We hope this teaching style suits you and we are excited to teach you the best!
