## What You'll Need

1. **Account Name**
   - This will appear on invoices, the AWS Organizations console, and other locations.
   - Use a clear naming convention:
     - For businesses: `company-purpose-environment` (e.g., `AnyCompany-audit-prod`).
     - For personal accounts: `first-last-purpose` (e.g., `john-doe-test`).

2. **Email Address**
   - Required as the root user’s sign-in name and for account recovery tasks.
   - Ensure it’s active and accessible.

3. **Phone Number**
   - Needed for account ownership verification.
   - Make sure the number is capable of receiving calls.

4. **Credit Card**
   - AWS requires a valid credit card during account setup, even if you're using free-tier services.

5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Device**
   - Recommended to enhance security.
   - Requires an MFA app or device for secondary authentication.

6. **AWS Support Plan**
   - Choose from Basic (free), Developer, Business, or Enterprise plans.
   - Learn more in the [Compare AWS Support Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/) documentation.
