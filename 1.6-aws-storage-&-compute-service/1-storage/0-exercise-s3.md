This guide walks through the basic operations you can perform with Amazon S3, from creating a bucket to uploading, downloading, copying, and deleting objects.

## Step 1: Create a Bucket

1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console:**
   - Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in.

   - Click **Create bucket**.

Your new bucket is now ready to use.

## Step 2: Upload an Object

3. **Choose Destination:**
   - Choose the destination bucket and specify the folder (if any) where you want the copied object to be placed.
   - Click **Copy**.

The object is now copied to the specified location.

## Step 5: Delete the Objects and Bucket

1. **Delete the Objects:**
   - Navigate to your bucket and select the objects you want to delete by checking the checkboxes.
