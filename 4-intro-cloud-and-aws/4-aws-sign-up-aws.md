# Sign Up for an AWS Account

1. Open [https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).
2. Choose **Create an AWS Account**.

3. Enter the account information and then choose **Continue**.

   It is essential that the account information is entered correctly, especially the email address. If the email address is entered incorrectly, access to the account may not be possible.

4. Choose either **Personal** or **Professional**.

   The difference between these options lies only in the information requested. Both account types offer the same features and functions.

5. Enter company or personal information.

6. Read and accept the [AWS Customer Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/).

7. Choose **Create Account and Continue**.

   At this point, an email message will be sent to confirm that the AWS account is ready for use. The account can be accessed using the email address and password provided during sign-up. However, AWS services cannot be used until the account activation process is complete.

8. On the Payment Information page, enter the payment method details. If a different address from the one used during account creation is preferred, choose **Use a new address** and enter the desired billing address.

9. Choose **Verify and Add**.

10. To verify the phone number, select the appropriate country or region code from the list and enter a phone number where a call can be received within the next few minutes. Complete the CAPTCHA code and submit.

11. The AWS automated verification system will call and provide a PIN. Enter the PIN using the phone and then choose **Continue**.

12. Select an AWS Support plan.

    For details on available plans, see [Compare AWS Support Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/).

A confirmation page will appear, indicating that the account is being activated. Activation typically takes a few minutes but can take up to 24 hours. During this time, sign-in to the new AWS account is possible, although the **Complete Sign Up** button may still be visible, which can be ignored.

AWS sends a confirmation email when the account activation is complete. It is recommended to check the inbox and spam folder for this email. Once the message is received, full access to all AWS services is granted.
