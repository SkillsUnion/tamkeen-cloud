# Troubleshooting AWS Account Creation Issues

Use the information provided here to help troubleshoot issues related to creating an AWS account.

## Issue: Not Receiving a Call from AWS to Verify the New Account

When creating an AWS account, a phone number must be provided that can receive either an SMS text message or a voice call. The preferred method for verifying the number is specified during the sign-up process.

If the message or call is not received, verify the following:

- The correct telephone number was entered, and the correct country code was selected during sign-up.
- If using a mobile phone, ensure that a cellular signal is available to receive SMS text messages or calls.
- The information entered for the payment method is correct.

If the SMS text message or call is not received to complete identity verification, AWS Support can manually activate the AWS account. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure availability at the telephone number provided for the AWS account.
2. Open the AWS Support console, and choose **Create case**.
   - Choose **Account and billing support**.
   - For **Type**, select **Account**.
   - For **Category**, select **Activation**.
   - In the **Case description** section, provide a date and time for when you can be reached.
   - In the **Contact options** section, select **Chat** for **Contact methods**.
   - Choose **Submit**.

## Issue: Receiving a "Maximum Number of Failed Attempts" Error During Phone Verification

AWS Support can assist with manually activating the account. Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS account using the email address and password specified during account creation.
2. Open the AWS Support console, and choose **Create case**.
3. Choose **Account and billing support**.
4. For **Type**, select **Account**.
5. For **Category**, select **Activation**.
6. In the **Case description** section, provide a date and time for when you can be reached.
7. In the **Contact options** section, select **Chat** for **Contact methods**.
8. Choose **Submit**.

AWS Support will contact you and attempt to manually activate your AWS account.

## Issue: Account Activation Takes Longer Than 24 Hours

Account activation delays may occur. If the process takes longer than 24 hours, check the following:

- **Complete the Account Activation Process**:  
  If the sign-up window was closed before all necessary information was added, reopen the registration page. Choose **Sign in to an existing AWS account**, and sign in using the email address and password created for the account.

- **Check Payment Information**:  
  In the AWS Billing and Cost Management console, check **Payment Methods** for any errors.

- **Contact the Financial Institution**:  
  Some financial institutions may reject authorization requests from AWS. Contact the institution associated with the payment method and request that they approve authorization requests from AWS. Note that AWS cancels the authorization request once itâ€™s approved, so no charges will be applied. However, authorization requests may still appear as a small charge (usually 1 USD) on the financial statement.

- **Check Email and Spam Folders**:  
  Look for any requests for additional information from AWS.

- **Try a Different Browser**:  
  Attempt the process using another web browser.

- **Contact AWS Support**:  
  Reach out to AWS Support for help and mention any troubleshooting steps already attempted.
