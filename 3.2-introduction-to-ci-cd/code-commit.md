# **AWS CodeCommit**

## 1. Introduction to AWS CodeCommit

AWS CodeCommit is a **fully managed, secure, and scalable source control service** that hosts private Git repositories in the cloud. It enables teams to collaborate on code securely, eliminating the need to operate and scale their own version control systems.

It is tightly integrated with other AWS services and supports standard Git tools, making it a strong choice for teams building applications on AWS infrastructure.

## 2. Key Concepts and Benefits

### 2.1 Git Compatibility

AWS CodeCommit supports the **standard Git protocol**, which means developers can use existing tools such as the Git CLI, GitHub Desktop, or IDE-based Git integrations with minimal adjustments.

### 2.2 Fully Managed Infrastructure

As a managed service, AWS CodeCommit:
- Automatically scales with your projects.
- Eliminates infrastructure management tasks.
- Provides high availability by replicating repositories across multiple Availability Zones.

### 2.3 Security and Compliance

- Integrated with **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** for fine-grained access control.
- **Encrypted at rest** with AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- **Encrypted in transit** with HTTPS or SSH.
- Supports integration with **federated identities** such as AWS SSO and Amazon Cognito.

### 2.4 Integration with AWS Developer Tools

CodeCommit integrates seamlessly with:
- **AWS CodeBuild** for building applications.
- **AWS CodeDeploy** for deployments.
- **AWS CodePipeline** for full CICD pipelines.

## 3. How It Works

A typical workflow with CodeCommit looks like this:

1. **Create a repository** in the AWS Management Console or via CLI.
2. **Clone** the repository to your local development environment.
3. **Commit and push changes** using standard Git commands.
4. **Collaborate** through Git features like pull requests and branches.
5. **Trigger CICD pipelines** using AWS CodePipeline or Git hooks.

## 4. Authentication Methods

AWS CodeCommit offers multiple authentication mechanisms:

| Method      | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **HTTPS**   | Uses IAM Git credentials or AWS access keys. |
| **SSH**     | Developers can upload public SSH keys to IAM. |
| **AWS SSO or Cognito** | Federated login for teams or enterprises. |

IAM policies define access at a granular level, such as per repository or per branch.

## 5. Monitoring and Auditing

- **AWS CloudTrail** logs all Git operations including clone, push, and pull.
- **Amazon CloudWatch** enables setting up alarms for repository events.
- **AWS Config** can track repository configuration changes.

## 6. Comparing AWS CodeCommit with Other Git Services

| Feature                     | CodeCommit      | GitHub          | GitLab           | Bitbucket        |
|----------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Git Support                | ✅               | ✅               | ✅                | ✅               |
| IAM Integration            | ✅               | ❌               | ❌                | ❌               |
| AWS-native Integration     | ✅               | ❌               | ❌                | ❌               |
| Built-in CICD             | ❌ (via CodePipeline) | ✅           | ✅                | ✅               |
| Cost (for small teams)     | Free for 5 users | Free plans       | Free plans        | Free plans       |

CodeCommit is ideal for teams already using AWS services and requiring strong IAM-based access controls.

## 7. Use Cases

- Private Git repositories for internal projects.
- Managing infrastructure code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
- Source control for AWS Lambda or container-based applications.
- Secure, auditable development environment within AWS.

---

## 8. Security Best Practices

- Use **IAM policies** to enforce least-privilege access.
- **Rotate Git credentials or SSH keys** periodically.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- Set up **branch protection** via Git workflows.
- Monitor usage via **CloudTrail** and **CloudWatch Logs**.

## 9. Pricing Overview

AWS CodeCommit is:
- **Free for up to 5 active users per month**.
- $1/user/month beyond that.
- Includes 50 GB of storage and 10,000 Git requests/month.

## **10. Best Practices for Teams**

- Structure repositories logically: one per service or app module.
- Use pull requests and code reviews.
- Tag releases using Git tags.
- Combine with CICD for automation.
- Monitor access logs and enable alerts.
