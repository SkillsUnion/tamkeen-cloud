# Compute Services

## Amazon EC2

### Overview
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

### Key Features
The simple web interface of Amazon EC2 allows users to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides complete control over computing resources and lets applications run on Amazon’s proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances (called Amazon EC2 instances) to minutes, allowing quick scaling of capacity, both up and down, as computing requirements change.

## Amazon Lightsail

### Overview
Amazon Lightsail is designed to be the easiest way to launch and manage a virtual private server with AWS.

### Key Features
Lightsail plans include everything needed to jumpstart a project, including a VM, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP address—all for a low, predictable price.

## Amazon Linux 2023

### Overview
Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) is a Linux-based operating system for AWS, designed to provide a secure, stable, high-performance environment for developing and running cloud applications.

### Key Features
AL2023 provides seamless integration with various AWS services and development tools and offers optimized performance for Amazon EC2 Graviton-based instances. The release cadence of every two years offers predictable cycles and up to 5 years of support. AL2023 also improves security by default, features preconfigured security policies, and provides deterministic upgrades through versioned repositories.

## AWS App Runner

### Overview
AWS App Runner is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs at scale.

### Key Features
AWS App Runner automatically builds, deploys, and scales web applications with load balancing and encryption. It also scales automatically to meet traffic needs, allowing developers to focus on applications instead of infrastructure.

## AWS Batch

### Overview
AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS.

### Key Features
AWS Batch dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources based on job requirements, eliminating the need to manage batch computing software or server clusters. The service plans, schedules, and runs batch computing workloads across AWS compute services.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Overview
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed in languages like Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker.

### Key Features
AWS Elastic Beanstalk handles deployment tasks like capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling while allowing full control over the underlying AWS resources.

## AWS Fargate

### Overview
AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows users to run containers without managing servers or clusters.

### Key Features
With Fargate, users only need to package their applications in containers, specify CPU and memory requirements, define networking and IAM policies, and launch the application without worrying about underlying infrastructure.

## AWS Lambda

### Overview
AWS Lambda lets users run code without provisioning or managing servers, charging only for the compute time consumed.

### Key Features
AWS Lambda is ideal for running code for virtually any application or backend service without the need for administration. Code can be set up to run automatically from other AWS services or called directly from web or mobile apps.

## AWS Serverless Application Repository

### Overview
The AWS Serverless Application Repository allows users to quickly deploy code samples, components, and complete applications for common use cases.

### Key Features
Each application is packaged with an AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template that defines the AWS resources used. Users can deploy publicly shared applications or publish their own for sharing within teams, organizations, or the community.

## AWS Outposts

### Overview
AWS Outposts bring native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility.

### Key Features
Outposts allow users to use the same APIs, tools, hardware, and functionality across on-premises and cloud environments. AWS Outposts infrastructure is fully managed, maintained, and supported by AWS.

## AWS Wavelength

### Overview
AWS Wavelength is an AWS infrastructure offering optimized for mobile edge computing applications.

### Key Features
Wavelength Zones embed AWS compute and storage services within communication service providers’ data centers at the edge of the 5G network, minimizing latency for mobile applications.

## VMware Cloud on AWS

### Overview
VMware Cloud on AWS is an integrated cloud offering jointly developed by AWS and VMware for seamlessly migrating and extending on-premises VMware vSphere-based environments to the AWS Cloud.

### Key Features
VMware Cloud on AWS allows organizations to run VMware's compute, storage, and network virtualization platforms alongside AWS infrastructure and platform services. It provides seamless workload portability between on-premises environments and the AWS Cloud, simplifying hybrid IT operations.
