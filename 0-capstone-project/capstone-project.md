# Capstone Project Brief  
**Cloud Engineering Program**

This capstone project is designed to help you apply and demonstrate the knowledge and skills you have acquired throughout the Cloud Engineering (AWS) program. It reflects real-world practices in cloud infrastructure deployment, automation, and operations using AWS services.

You may choose from the options below based on your comfort level and experience. The project will span **two weeks**, during which instructors will be available to support you. There will be regular check-ins and a final presentation at the end of the project period.

You can choose to complete the project **individually** or in **groups**. Collaboration is encouraged through the Disco platform or other communication tools to simulate teamwork in a professional cloud engineering environment.

> **Note:** This project is **optional** and **not graded**. However, completing it is highly recommended as it helps reinforce core concepts, strengthen your technical portfolio, and prepare you for real-world cloud engineering roles.
