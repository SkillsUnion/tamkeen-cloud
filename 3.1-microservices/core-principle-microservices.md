# **Core Principles of Microservices**

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Identify the foundational principles that define microservice architecture.
- Explain how these principles impact system design, team organization, and infrastructure.
- Apply the principles when analyzing or designing microservices-based systems.
- Recognize how these principles differ from those in monolithic applications.

## **Single Responsibility and Bounded Context**

Each microservice should **focus on a single business capability**—no more, no less. This aligns with the **Single Responsibility Principle** (SRP) from software design, ensuring that each service does one thing well.

**Bounded Context** is a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concept that defines **clear service boundaries** where business logic and data rules are consistent. For example:
- A `PaymentService` shouldn't handle customer profile logic.
- A `UserService` shouldn't manage order data.

> Keeping services focused reduces cognitive load and allows teams to iterate quickly without affecting other domains.

## **Decentralized Data Management**

Microservices favor **independent data ownership**—each service should manage its own database or datastore. This avoids tight coupling and enables services to evolve independently.

**Key Concepts**:
- No shared database between services.
- Services communicate via APIs, not direct DB queries.
- Use eventual consistency and events where needed (e.g., publish an event after a payment is confirmed).

**Trade-off**: Avoiding a centralized database can increase complexity in maintaining data consistency across services, but it pays off with better scalability and independence.

## **Statelessness**

Microservices should ideally be **stateless**, meaning they don't store session information between requests. Each request should be self-contained, with all needed data included.

**Why statelessness matters**:
- Improves **horizontal scalability** (services can scale by spinning up more instances).
- Simplifies **fault recovery** and **load balancing**.
- Works well with **containers and serverless architectures** (e.g., ECS Fargate, AWS Lambda).

**Workaround for state**: Use managed storage systems (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB, S3) for state persistence, session tracking, or caching.

---

## **Autonomous, Independently Deployable Units**

Each microservice should be **deployable and updatable without coordination** with other services. This autonomy supports:
- Independent release cycles.
- Easier rollbacks and experimentation.
- Distributed ownership across teams (DevOps responsibility per team).

**Real-World Practice**:
- Teams build and deploy services they own.
- CICD pipelines are isolated per service.
- Updates to one service don’t require system-wide redeployments.

---

## **Decentralized Governance and Polyglotism**

Microservices allow teams to **choose the best tools** for the job—whether that’s language, framework, or database.

**Polyglot Principle**:
- One service can be in Node.js, another in Go or Python.
- Choose PostgreSQL for transactional services, DynamoDB for high-scale reads.

**Governance** should be **lightweight**—some shared standards (e.g., API format, logging) but freedom where needed. However, overusing polyglotism can lead to **increased operational overhead**, so balance is key.

---

## **Resilience and Failure Isolation**

Microservices are distributed systems—failures will happen. They should be **designed to handle partial failures gracefully**, and **fail fast** when necessary.

**Principles**:
- Use timeouts and retries for service calls.
- Implement circuit breakers (e.g., with libraries like Hystrix, Resilience4j).
- Apply bulkheads: isolate failures so they don’t cascade.
- Use queues or events to decouple time-sensitive operations.

> Design every microservice as if the downstream dependency could fail.

---

## **Observable and Transparent**

A microservice system should be **observable**—engineers need insight into what services are doing and how they’re interacting.

**Best Practices**:
- Structured, centralized logging (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, ELK Stack).
- Distributed tracing (e.g., AWS X-Ray, OpenTelemetry).
- Metrics (latency, request count, error rates) exposed via dashboards.

> "If you can’t observe it, you can’t maintain it."

## **Communicate Through APIs or Messaging**

Microservices **communicate over the network**, usually through:
- **Synchronous APIs**: REST, gRPC
- **Asynchronous messaging**: Event-driven (SNS, SQS, Kafka, EventBridge)

**Key Considerations**:
- REST is simple and widespread, ideal for direct client-server interaction.
- Events and messaging decouple services and improve resilience but introduce complexity (event schemas, idempotency).

## **Discussion Prompts**

- How do stateless services differ in deployment and scalability from stateful ones?
- When is shared governance between teams beneficial or harmful?
- Have you ever worked on a team that owned its own deployable unit? What worked and what didn’t?
