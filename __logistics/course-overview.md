### **1. BASIC CLOUD COMPUTING AND LINUX FUNDAMENTALS**
**Objective:**  
Gain a deep understanding of cloud computing concepts and Linux, the primary OS in cloud environments.

- **Cloud Fundamentals**:
  - **Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)**: Learn the different service levels in the cloud stack and how to select the right model for different use cases.
  - **Deployment Models (Public, Private, Hybrid)**: Understand how cloud services are deployed and managed, with examples of when to use each model.

- **Linux Fundamentals**:
  - **Linux Commands**: Master basic Linux navigation commands (`ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `chmod`) and utilities like `top`, `ps`, `netstat`.
  - **File Permissions**: Learn to manage user and file permissions.
  - **Shell Scripting**: Understand how to write simple scripts for automating tasks.

- **Learning Resources**:
  - **Books**: "The Linux Command Line" by William E. Shotts.
  - **Courses**: Linux Foundation's introductory courses.

### **5. CLOUD INTEGRATION & IAC TOOLS**
**Objective:**  
Master cloud automation through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage resources effectively and improve consistency.

- **Key Tools**:
  - **Terraform**: A cloud-agnostic tool to manage and provision infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.
  - **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS-specific tool for managing resources through templates.
  - **Ansible**: For configuration management and automation.

- **Concepts to Learn**:
  - **IaC Best Practices**: Writing modular, reusable IaC templates.
  - **Version Control for Infrastructure**: Use Git to manage and track infrastructure changes.

- **Hands-on Practice**:
  - Build a cloud environment using Terraform, automating the setup of compute, networking, and storage resources.
  - Use Ansible for configuration management across cloud instances.

### **6. CONTAINER & ORCHESTRATION**
**Objective:**  
Understand how to build, manage, and scale containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes.

- **Key Technologies**:
  - **Docker**: Learn how to package applications into containers to ensure consistency across environments.
  - **Kubernetes**: Master container orchestration for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.

- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Containerization**: Learn to build Docker images, run containers, and manage container networking.
  - **Kubernetes Basics**: Understand pods, deployments, services, and autoscaling.

- **Hands-on Practice**:
  - Deploy a containerized application using AWS ECS.

---

### **7. DEVOPS PRACTICES**
**Objective:**  
Learn the principles of DevOps to automate and streamline cloud infrastructure development, testing, and deployment processes.

- **DevOps Concepts**:
  - **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate code integration, testing, and deployment.
  - **Collaboration**: Foster better collaboration between development and operations teams through automation and monitoring tools.

- **AWS DevOps Tools**:
  - **AWS CodePipeline**: Automate the build, test, and deploy processes using AWS's CI/CD service.
  - **AWS CodeBuild**: Build and test code with a fully managed build service from AWS.
  - **AWS CodeDeploy**: Automate the deployment of applications to EC2, Lambda, and on-premises servers.

- **Hands-on Practice**:
  - Set up a CI/CD pipeline with the right tools to automatically deploy updates to a cloud environment.
  - Configure networking components such as load balancers and VPNs for secure, scalable infrastructure.
