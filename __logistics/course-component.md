# ðŸ§© Course Components

## SWE Fundamentals

The SWE Fundamentals course utilizes a flipped classroom model, consisting of two main components: self-learning and live classes.

### Self-Learning

The purpose of self-learning is to ensure that students grasp key concepts before attending class, allowing class time to be dedicated to discussions. Self-learning is mandatory and includes videos and exercises listed under the "Pre-Class" header.

### Live Classes

Live classes are designed to deepen students' understanding of the concepts learned during self-learning through instructor-led discussions and pair-programming exercises. Attendance is mandatory. 

- **Platform:** Zoom
- **Schedule:** There will be one pre-course briefing and 12 live classes in total. Each section will have its own Zoom room.

#### Structure of Live Classes:
1. **Concept Review (30 minutes):** Students explain and review concepts with their section.
2. **Pair Programming (85 minutes):** Students work on in-class exercises with a designated peer.
3. **Q&A and Preview (5 minutes):** Students can ask questions, and the instructor will preview the next class.

### Pair Programming

Pair programming is a collaborative software engineering activity where two engineers work on the same problem together on the same computer. Typically, one engineer acts as the "driver," writing the code, while the other acts as the "navigator," guiding the overall strategy and researching documentation.

#### Common Uses of Pair Programming:
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Between team members or between juniors and seniors, where the navigator is often more experienced.
- **Quality Assurance:** To ensure that critical software is developed correctly, especially when mistakes could have significant future repercussions.

During SWE Fundamentals, pair programming will be used to reinforce understanding of concepts by coding and explaining solutions to each other. The majority of class time will be dedicated to pair programming, with pairs changing for each live class.

### Exercise and Project Strategy

It's essential to read through all sections of exercises and projects before starting. Later parts may require different approaches or code architecture, and failing to plan accordingly could lead to significant refactoring.

#### Base and More Comfortable Sections

To accommodate varying learning speeds and prior experience, exercises and projects are divided into two sections:

- **Base:** This section must be completed to minimally understand the relevant concepts. If short on time, focus on completing the Base section before moving on.
- **More Comfortable:** This section is for students who wish to challenge themselves further. Completing this section is optional but offers additional experience, which may be advantageous in the job market.
