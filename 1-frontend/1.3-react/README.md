# 1.3: React

## Introduction

<a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank">React</a> is a frontend framework and library that allows us to create custom, nest-able UI elements with a combination of HTML and JavaScript syntax (JSX). React's HTML-like structure makes it easy to visualise, and its integrated JS makes it easy to render dynamic data. Alternative but less popular frontend libraries include <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a>.

We will use React's official <a href="https://react.dev/learn" target="_blank">guide</a> and <a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to learn React, and the <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/" target="_blank">Vitejs</a> environment to scaffold our first React apps. Vite is a build tool that provides a fast and lean development experience for modern web projects. Vite leverages new advancements in the JavaScript ecosystems, the ability of native ES modules within the browser and the rise of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages. This is because browsers do not read React natively; they read HTML, CSS and JS, not JSX.

The following sections provide Rocket's annotations to React's official <a href="https://react.dev/learn" target="_blank">guide</a> and <a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to explain concepts that the React team assumes readers know.


## Optional: <a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">Tutorial: Intro to React</a>

If you finish the React Guide pages above early, feel free to start and finish this tutorial early to have more time for [Project 1](../1.p-frontend-app.md).

1. Rocket recommends starting with Setup Option 1 (Write Code in Browser) to focus on understanding React. If you finish the tutorial and have time, do Setup Option 2 (Local Development Environment) and port your code over to understand how to use Create React App. We will use Create React App to develop all frontend projects at Rocket.
2. Rocket recommends using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en" target="_blank">React DevTools</a> whenever developing React apps. It can help us debug quicker.
3. Note the tutorial's recommendation to use `on[Event]` naming convention for props that represent events and `handle[Event]` for methods that handle events.
