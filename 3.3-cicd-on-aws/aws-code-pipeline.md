# AWS CodePipeline

## 1. Introduction
AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that helps automate the steps required to release software changes. It allows developers to model and visualize their software release process as a series of stages, providing both flexibility and control in managing deployments. With CodePipeline, updates to source code automatically trigger pipeline executions, leading to automated builds, tests, and deployments.

By using CodePipeline, teams can achieve faster, more reliable delivery of features and updates. It supports integrations with a variety of AWS services such as CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, and also third-party services like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Jenkins.

## 2. Benefits
- **End-to-End Automation**: Automates the entire release process from code commit to deployment.
- **Modular and Flexible**: Build your pipeline using pre-built or custom actions.
- **Built-in Integrations**: Connects seamlessly with AWS services and third-party tools.
- **Speed and Reliability**: Reduces manual steps, allowing for faster and more predictable deployments.
- **Visual Monitoring**: Real-time visualization of pipeline execution and stage status.
- **Custom Triggers and Conditions**: Define rules for automatic execution, manual approvals, and conditional logic.

## 3. Key Concepts
AWS CodePipeline uses a structured set of concepts to define and execute automated workflows. Understanding these concepts is essential for designing scalable and maintainable CI/CD pipelines.

### 3.1 Pipeline
A pipeline is the top-level construct that models the complete release process of an application. It consists of a sequence of **stages**, each responsible for a discrete phase of the release cycle. Pipelines are configured to respond to changes in source repositories or manual triggers, enabling continuous delivery.

### 3.2 Stage
Stages are logical divisions within a pipeline, often corresponding to phases such as source retrieval, build, testing, approval, and deployment. Each stage can contain multiple **actions** that execute in parallel or sequentially. You can control transitions between stages using success criteria or manual approvals.

### 3.3 Action
Actions are individual units of work performed within a stage. AWS supports several built-in action categories, including:
- **Source**: Retrieves source code from repositories like CodeCommit or GitHub.
- **Build**: Executes build jobs using CodeBuild or Jenkins.
- **Test**: Performs tests or validations.
- **Deploy**: Deploys applications using CodeDeploy, ECS, Lambda, or CloudFormation.
- **Approval**: Pauses the pipeline for manual approval before continuing.
- **Invoke**: Triggers AWS Lambda functions to run custom logic.

### 3.4 Artifact
Artifacts are the intermediate files or build outputs passed between actions. An action can produce **output artifacts** and consume **input artifacts**. These artifacts are stored in a secure S3 bucket and are used to transport data across pipeline stages.

### 3.5 Execution
Each time a pipeline is triggered, it creates a new **execution**. This represents an isolated run of the entire pipeline, tracking the outcome of each stage and action. Executions can succeed, fail, or be superseded, and their logs are available for review.

### 3.6 Trigger
Triggers define the events that cause a pipeline to start an execution. Common trigger types include:
- Source code changes (e.g., commit to Git repository)
- Manual starts via the console or CLI
- Scheduled or custom events using Amazon EventBridge

## 4. Pipeline Structure
A typical CodePipeline consists of:

```text
Source  ->  Build  ->  Test  ->  Deploy
```

You can create complex workflows using multiple stages, parallel actions, manual approvals, and custom logic.

Example YAML (used in CloudFormation or CDK to define a pipeline):

```yaml
Resources:
  MyPipeline:
    Type: AWS::CodePipeline::Pipeline
    Properties:
      RoleArn: !GetAtt PipelineRole.Arn
      ArtifactStore:
        Type: S3
        Location: !Ref ArtifactBucket
      Stages:
        - Name: Source
          Actions:
            - Name: SourceCode
              ActionTypeId:
                Category: Source
                Owner: AWS
                Provider: CodeCommit
                Version: 1
              OutputArtifacts:
                - Name: SourceOutput
              Configuration:
                RepositoryName: MyRepo
                BranchName: main
        - Name: Build
          Actions:
            - Name: BuildProject
              ActionTypeId:
                Category: Build
                Owner: AWS
                Provider: CodeBuild
                Version: 1
              InputArtifacts:
                - Name: SourceOutput
              OutputArtifacts:
                - Name: BuildOutput
              Configuration:
                ProjectName: MyBuildProject
```

## 5. Execution Modes
Execution modes determine how CodePipeline handles multiple simultaneous triggers or changes. This is important when managing environments with frequent commits or long-running deployment steps.

- **SUPERSEDED**: This is the default behavior. If a new execution is started and an existing execution is blocked or in a pending stage, the older one is marked as superseded and canceled in favor of the newer run. This prevents resource contention and avoids redundant operations.

- **QUEUED**: In queued mode, pipeline executions are placed in a queue and processed in order. Only one execution runs at a time, and new ones wait their turn. This mode is useful when deploying to shared environments or resources that require sequential updates.

- **PARALLEL**: Available with V2 pipelines, this mode allows multiple pipeline executions to run concurrently. Itâ€™s useful for teams that require high throughput CI/CD pipelines or that support multiple independent releases.

Understanding and configuring execution modes correctly helps teams balance throughput with stability and resource usage.

## 6. Deployment Integrations
CodePipeline integrates with a wide range of deployment targets, making it versatile for different application types and environments. The service supports built-in integrations with:

- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Enables deployment to Amazon EC2, on-premises instances, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS using in-place or blue/green deployment strategies.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Simplifies the deployment of web applications and services with automatic scaling and monitoring.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Manages infrastructure as code, enabling the deployment of entire stacks along with application updates.
- **Amazon S3**: Ideal for deploying static websites by uploading built artifacts directly to S3 buckets configured for website hosting.
- **Jenkins or Other Tools**: You can integrate external deployment tools like Jenkins by configuring custom or invoke actions that trigger jobs in your preferred CI/CD environment.

Each of these deployment options can be integrated into the final stage of your pipeline, enabling end-to-end delivery from code to live production.

## 7. Manual Approvals
Manual approval actions provide a checkpoint in the pipeline where human intervention is required before proceeding. This is particularly valuable in regulated industries or production releases where changes must be reviewed and authorized before deployment.

Manual approvals can be inserted into any stage except the Source stage. When triggered, the pipeline pauses until an authorized user either approves or rejects the action. You can also configure SNS notifications to alert reviewers.

Approvals are defined using an `ActionTypeId` with category `Approval`, and can include optional comments, external URLs, and timeout settings.

Example configuration (YAML):
```yaml
- Name: Approval
  Actions:
    - Name: ManualApproval
      ActionTypeId:
        Category: Approval
        Owner: AWS
        Provider: Manual
        Version: 1
      Configuration:
        CustomData: "Please verify deployment readiness."
        NotificationArn: arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:Approvals
```

This feature helps enforce governance, prevents unauthorized deployments, and ensures quality assurance checkpoints are part of your CI/CD lifecycle.

## 8. Advanced Features
- **Conditional Stage Execution**: Use variables, alarms, or custom conditions to control flow.
- **Cross-region Actions**: Deploy and manage resources across AWS Regions.
- **Pipeline Variables**: Customize action behavior dynamically.
- **Custom Actions**: Integrate with your own systems or providers.

## 9. Monitoring and Logs
- **CloudWatch Logs**: View logs for individual action execution.
- **CloudTrail**: Track API calls for auditing.
- **EventBridge**: Receive events for pipeline execution changes.

## 10. Security
- Use IAM roles for pipelines and actions.
- Apply least privilege principle.
- Use encrypted artifact stores (S3 + KMS).
- Enable approval actions for production deployments.

## 11. Best Practices
- Use `Source -> Build -> Test -> Deploy` structure.
- Keep pipeline logic in code (CDK, CloudFormation).
- Use notifications for failed stages.
- Use variables and conditions for flexible flows.
- Prefer event-based triggers (via EventBridge) over polling.
