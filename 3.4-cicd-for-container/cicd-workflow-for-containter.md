# CI/CD Workflow for Containers on AWS

## 1. Introduction
In a modern DevOps environment, container-based applications are the foundation of scalable, maintainable microservices. Implementing a robust CI/CD workflow for containers enables developers to build, test, and deploy changes quickly and reliably. AWS offers a suite of fully managed services that support CI/CD automation for container workloads, ensuring efficiency, security, and scalability across all stages of the software delivery lifecycle.

This document outlines a comprehensive CI/CD workflow for containerized applications using AWS services including CodeCommit, CodeBuild, Amazon ECR, CodePipeline, ECS, and optionally EKS.

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline Stages for Containers
A typical AWS container-based CI/CD workflow includes the following sequential stages:

### 2.1. **Source Control (CodeCommit / GitHub)**
Code changes are committed to a Git-based source repository. This acts as the trigger for the CI/CD process.

### 2.2. **Build and Unit Testing (CodeBuild)**
AWS CodeBuild is responsible for compiling the application, running tests, building Docker images from the source code, and preparing the application artifacts. This includes creating and pushing Docker images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

### 2.3. **Container Registry (Amazon ECR)**
Built images are tagged (often with Git SHAs or semantic versioning) and pushed to a centralized Amazon ECR repository. These images serve as immutable artifacts ready for deployment.

### 2.4. **Pipeline Orchestration (CodePipeline)**
AWS CodePipeline orchestrates the entire CI/CD process, linking the source, build, and deployment stages. It ensures each change goes through all necessary steps before reaching production.

### 2.5. **Deployment (Amazon ECS or EKS)**
The final deployment stage updates the container orchestrator (ECS or EKS) to pull the new Docker image from ECR and deploy it to the desired compute environment (e.g., Fargate or EC2-backed services).

## 3. Step-by-Step CI/CD Flow

1. **Developer pushes code to CodeCommit**
   - Includes Dockerfile, source code, and buildspec.yml

2. **CodePipeline is triggered**
   - Source stage detects the push and passes artifacts to the build stage

3. **CodeBuild executes the build**
   - Runs automated tests
   - Builds Docker image
   - Pushes image to ECR
   - Generates `imagedefinitions.json` for ECS deployments

4. **CodePipeline triggers the Deploy stage**
   - ECS service is updated with the new image tag
   - Rolling updates are executed automatically by ECS

5. **Post-deployment verification**
   - CloudWatch monitors metrics and logs
   - Alarms can be set to roll back deployments on failure

## 4. Sample Pipeline Configuration

### buildspec.yml
```yaml
version: 0.2
phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
      - aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com
      - IMAGE_TAG=$(echo $CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION | cut -c 1-7)
      - REPOSITORY_URI=$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/my-app
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Building Docker image...
      - docker build -t $REPOSITORY_URI:$IMAGE_TAG .
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Pushing Docker image...
      - docker push $REPOSITORY_URI:$IMAGE_TAG
      - echo Creating imagedefinitions.json...
      - printf '[{"name":"app","imageUri":"%s"}]' $REPOSITORY_URI:$IMAGE_TAG > imagedefinitions.json
artifacts:
  files:
    - imagedefinitions.json
```

### pipeline.json (excerpt)
```json
{
  "name": "MyContainerPipeline",
  "stages": [
    {
      "name": "Source",
      "actions": [ /* CodeCommit or GitHub Source */ ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Build",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "BuildDockerImage",
          "actionTypeId": {
            "category": "Build",
            "owner": "AWS",
            "provider": "CodeBuild",
            "version": "1"
          },
          "configuration": {
            "ProjectName": "MyDockerBuildProject"
          },
          "inputArtifacts": [ { "name": "SourceOutput" } ],
          "outputArtifacts": [ { "name": "BuildOutput" } ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Deploy",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "ECSDeploy",
          "actionTypeId": {
            "category": "Deploy",
            "owner": "AWS",
            "provider": "ECS",
            "version": "1"
          },
          "configuration": {
            "ClusterName": "my-cluster",
            "ServiceName": "my-service",
            "FileName": "imagedefinitions.json"
          },
          "inputArtifacts": [ { "name": "BuildOutput" } ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Tools Comparison: ECS vs EKS
| Feature               | Amazon ECS                   | Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)         |
|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Simplicity           | Easier to configure & manage | More flexible, but complex      |
| Orchestration Engine | Proprietary (AWS native)     | Kubernetes                       |
| Deployment Options   | Fargate / EC2                | Fargate / EC2                    |
| Use Case Fit         | Small to medium workloads     | Enterprise-grade microservices   |

## 6. Monitoring and Rollback
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Logs and metrics for builds, deployments, and application runtime
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Track API events across CI/CD resources
- **Amazon SNS**: Notify teams on build/deploy success/failure
- **Rollback Options**:
  - ECS deployment configuration with minimum healthy percent
  - Revert to previous container image tag manually or automatically

## 7. Summary
This CI/CD workflow enables development teams to automate the build, test, and deployment of containerized applications in AWS. By chaining services such as CodeCommit, CodeBuild, ECR, CodePipeline, and ECS/EKS, teams can achieve high development velocity, maintain application stability, and deliver software faster and more reliably.
