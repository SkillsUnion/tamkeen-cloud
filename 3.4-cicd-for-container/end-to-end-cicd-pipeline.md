# Automating End-to-End CICD Pipeline for Containers on AWS

## 1. Introduction
Automating the end-to-end CICD pipeline for containers on AWS significantly improves developer productivity and accelerates release cycles. With the integration of AWS services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, Amazon ECR, CodePipeline, and Amazon ECS or EKS, development teams can deploy changes continuously and reliably.

This guide provides a complete overview and hands-on strategy to fully automate container-based deployments in AWS, from source code to production deployment.

## 2. Architecture Overview
A typical end-to-end CICD container pipeline includes:

1. **CodeCommit/GitHub** – Source code version control
2. **CodeBuild** – Builds the Docker image and pushes to ECR
3. **ECR** – Stores the container image
4. **CodePipeline** – Orchestrates the workflow
5. **ECS or EKS** – Deploys the image to the production environment

**Visual Flow:**
```
+------------+     +-----------+     +------------+     +--------+     +----------+
| CodeCommit | --> | CodeBuild | --> |    ECR     | --> |Pipeline| --> | ECS/EKS  |
+------------+     +-----------+     +------------+     +--------+     +----------+
```

## 3. Core Components

### Source Repository
Use AWS CodeCommit or GitHub to store your application code, Dockerfile, and buildspec.yml. This acts as the trigger point for the pipeline.

### Build & Push with CodeBuild
CodeBuild automates building Docker images, running tests, and pushing images to ECR. It uses `buildspec.yml` to define build instructions.

### Image Registry with Amazon ECR
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed Docker image registry. It stores your tagged container images securely.

### Deployment Orchestration with CodePipeline
CodePipeline links all stages and automates the build, test, and deployment lifecycle.

### Deployment Target with ECS or EKS
Amazon ECS (with Fargate or EC2) or Amazon EKS (Kubernetes) runs the deployed containers.

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare the Repository
Your repository must include:
- Application source code
- Dockerfile
- buildspec.yml (for CodeBuild)
- Optional: `imagedefinitions.json` (for ECS deployment)

### Step 2: Create ECR Repository
```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-app
```

### Step 3: Define `buildspec.yml`
```yaml
version: 0.2
phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - $(aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ECR_URI>)
      - IMAGE_TAG=$(echo $CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION | cut -c 1-7)
      - REPOSITORY_URI=<ECR_URI>
  build:
    commands:
      - docker build -t $REPOSITORY_URI:$IMAGE_TAG .
  post_build:
    commands:
      - docker push $REPOSITORY_URI:$IMAGE_TAG
      - printf '[{"name":"app","imageUri":"%s"}]' $REPOSITORY_URI:$IMAGE_TAG > imagedefinitions.json
artifacts:
  files:
    - imagedefinitions.json
```

### Step 4: Create CodeBuild Project
Use the AWS CLI or Console to define a CodeBuild project pointing to your repo and buildspec file.

### Step 5: Create CodePipeline
Define stages in JSON:
- **Source**: Connect to CodeCommit/GitHub
- **Build**: Trigger CodeBuild project
- **Deploy**: ECS or EKS (optional in first iteration)

### Sample ECS Deployment Stage:
```json
{
  "name": "Deploy",
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "ECSDeploy",
      "actionTypeId": {
        "category": "Deploy",
        "owner": "AWS",
        "provider": "ECS",
        "version": "1"
      },
      "configuration": {
        "ClusterName": "my-cluster",
        "ServiceName": "my-service",
        "FileName": "imagedefinitions.json"
      },
      "inputArtifacts": [
        {
          "name": "BuildOutput"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 6: Execute and Monitor
Once created, the pipeline will automatically:
- Detect code changes
- Build and push images
- Trigger ECS to roll out the new version

Monitor logs via CloudWatch and deployment status in CodePipeline UI.

## 5. Best Practices
- Use immutable tags (e.g., commit SHA) for container images
- Enable ECR image scanning for vulnerabilities
- Set up IAM roles with least-privilege
- Separate pipelines per environment (dev/stage/prod)
- Use approval stages for production

## 6. Summary
Automating the CICD pipeline for containers on AWS reduces manual tasks, standardizes delivery, and accelerates deployments. Leveraging AWS-native tools provides deep integration, security, and operational visibility for containerized applications.
