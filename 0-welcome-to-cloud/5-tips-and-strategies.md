# Getting Started

## How to Break a Problem Down
One of the biggest challenges when starting a project is figuring out where to begin. There are three main steps in this process:

### 1. Understand Your Problem
   - **Define the Problem**: Make sure you understand the problem from a programming perspective.
   - **Purpose**: Understand what the application is supposed to accomplish.
   - **Logic**: Make sure you grasp the core logic of the application.

### 2. Strategize Your Approach
   - **Start Small**: Begin with the "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP).
   - **Focus on Essentials**: Leave out features that are not essential to the main purpose of the program.
   - **Plan for Simplicity**: Think about simplifying parts of the program, e.g., simulating a dice roll with a fixed value if it fits the purpose.

### 3. Translate the Problem into the logical flow
   - **Control Flow**: Processes and logic might require loops or conditionals.
   - **Data Types and Structures**: Identify the data types and structures you need, like arrays for ordered lists or numbers for calculations.

## Building Mental Models
Programming is about creating a mental model of what happens when the code runs. Here are some strategies to develop these models:

### Mental Model Building Strategies
   - **Run Your Code Often**: Write code in small pieces, testing each part as soon as possible.
   - **Test Hypotheses with Code**: Approach code with an experimental mindset—use `console.log` to verify control flow and variable values.
   - **Avoid Fixing, Focus on Understanding**: Don’t aim to fix errors directly; instead, understand why they happen.

## Learning Strategies
Develop computational thinking by building solid mental models and using mistakes as learning opportunities.

   - **Embrace Errors**: Errors are part of programming. Use them as learning tools and be playful—don’t fear breaking things.
   - **Ask Questions**: Regularly question your understanding. What did you try? What causes the error? What do you think is happening?
   - **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Talk through your problem to clarify your thoughts. https://rubberduckdebugging.com/

## Pro Tips
Maximize your productivity by building an efficient and distraction-free coding environment.

   - **Know Your Tools**: Master dev tools, keyboard shortcuts, and Git/GitHub for easy version control and troubleshooting.
   - **Utilize Google and ChatGPT**: Searching skills are essential. Practice using the right keywords and understanding when solutions might be adaptable to your needs.

## Deliberate Practice
Coding is more like learning a musical instrument than memorizing facts—it’s about practice and developing skill through experience.

   - **Quality Over Quantity**: Effective learning relies on focused, deliberate practice and a mindful approach to your coding process.
